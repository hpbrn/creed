// Pure permission logic for Shared Creeds.
//
// No IO, no DB, no React: just the rules that decide what a role, a member, or
// a member's agent may do to a section.
// Kept pure and dependency-free (only a type-only import) so it is unit-testable
// with `node --test` and shared byte-identically by three call sites:
//
//   1. the server payload builders (strip Hidden sections before they leave),
//   2. the shared write-route guards (reject writes the caller may not make),
//   3. the client UI (grey out / lock what the member cannot do).
//
// The DB helpers creed_role() and creed_section_permission() encode the same
// rules in SQL for RLS; this module is their TypeScript twin. Keep them in sync.
