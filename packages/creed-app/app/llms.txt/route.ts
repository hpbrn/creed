## Details

A personal context file is one structured profile that describes who you are and how you want AI to respond. Creed organizes it into ten sections: Identity, Goals, Work, Preferences, and Routines as the always-on core, plus optional Beliefs, Constraints, People, Health, and Context.

Agents connect over MCP (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, ChatGPT) and read the file before answering, then propose narrowly scoped updates that you approve. The file is plain Markdown you own: bring your own AI key, keep your tokens, and export or delete everything at any time. There is no lock-in.

Creed Open v1 is a private, single-owner application for Personal Creeds. Shared Creeds, managed Cloud hosting, and the Creed CLI are on the roadmap.
