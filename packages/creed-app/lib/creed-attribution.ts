//   MCP agent      -> "[member]'s [agent]"          e.g. "Fergus's Claude Code"
//   panel agent    -> "[member]'s Creed"            e.g. "Fergus's Creed"
//
// Vague attribution ("Codex made a proposal") is never produced: an agent action
// always carries the member it acted for. Pure and dependency-free so it is
// unit-testable and usable on both server and client.
