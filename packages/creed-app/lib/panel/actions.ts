// Panel's NAVIGATOR vocabulary, shared by Search (smart find) and Ask (chat).
// Isomorphic on purpose - the client executes these actions, and the server
// builds the model prompt + validates the reply against the same registry, so
// what the model is told exists and what the client can execute can never
// drift apart.
//
// This layer NEVER mutates the creed. It navigates, sets view controls, and
// answers questions. Everything that changes content or structure lives in the
// Agent layer (lib/panel/agent.ts), which speaks the MCP proposal contract.
//
// Deliberately limited to pure local helpers so the validator stays isomorphic
// and the node test runner can import it without path-alias resolution.
