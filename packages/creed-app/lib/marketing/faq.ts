    question: "What actually goes in a Creed?",
    answer:
      "Who you are, what you're working toward, how you like AI to talk to you, the people and routines that shape your week, plus any health, accessibility, or hard noes AI should respect. One concise profile, not a journal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why not just retell every AI who I am each time?",
    answer:
      "Because it doesn't stick, doesn't cross tools, and you end up repeating yourself. Creed gives every AI the same profile to read before answering, and lets them propose updates as they learn more about you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which tools does Creed work with?",
    answer:
      "Creed connects to agents like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and ChatGPT over MCP, and integrates with GitHub for version control. Support for tools like Notion and Obsidian is coming for editing and storage.",
  },
  {
    question: "What gets written back to Creed?",
    answer:
      "Durable things AI learns about you, a sharper preference, a new routine, a goal that shifted. Not session recap, not mood, not generic praise.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to review every change?",
    answer:
      "No. You can keep agent edits reviewable, or trust them to write directly when you want a lighter loop. The point is control when you want it, not friction by default.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Creed for teams or just for me?",
    answer:
      "Creed Open v1 is built for one owner and Personal Creeds. Shared Creeds are being developed for Creed Cloud and are listed on the roadmap.",
  },
];

// FAQ for the /pricing page. Answers the billing questions a buyer actually
// has, phrased as standalone facts so an answer engine can quote one item.
export const pricingFaqItems: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "Is Creed free?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Creed Open is free and MIT licensed. You self-host Personal Creeds with MCP, GitHub version control, import, and export. Creed Cloud is still in development.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are usage credits?",
    answer:
      "Managed usage credits are planned for Creed Cloud. Creed Open uses your own OpenRouter API key for Analysis, Panel, and Tab.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is BYOK?",
    answer:
      "BYOK means bring your own key. In Creed Open, you connect an OpenRouter key so model usage runs on your account.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch between monthly and yearly?",
    answer:
      "Creed Cloud is not available for public signup yet. Pricing and billing details will be published when it is ready.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I own my data, and can I cancel?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your Creed is plain Markdown you can export at any time, and the Open installation stores data in the Supabase project you control.",
  },
];

// Shared collaboration facts retained for reusable docs surfaces.
export const sharedFaqItems: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What is a Shared Creed?",
    answer:
      "A Shared Creed is one shared context file that every member's agents read before they act. It holds the canonical shared context: how the team works, what it is building, and the conventions and constraints that apply to everyone, so agents stop drifting from how the team actually operates.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is it different from a wiki or knowledge base?",
    answer:
      "A wiki is a large, complete record for people to search. A Shared Creed is short, curated, and written to be read by agents before they answer. It is the profile your AI reads, not the archive your team browses. Most teams keep both.",
  },
  {
    question: "What roles does a Shared Creed have?",
    answer:
      "Three: Owner, who manages members and content; Admin, who manages members and content; and Member, who reads and proposes. Section permissions control who edits each section directly versus by proposal, and every change is attributed in the activity view.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do team members need their own personal Creed?",
    answer:
      "No. A member needs a Creed account to accept an invitation, but not a Cloud subscription. They connect their own agents over MCP and read the Shared Creed. They can keep a Personal Creed too and switch between them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does a Shared Creed cost more?",
    answer:
      "Shared Creeds are not part of Creed Open v1. Availability and pricing will be published with Creed Cloud.",
  },
];

// FAQ about personal context files (surfaced in llms-full.txt). Phrased as direct, standalone answers
// so answer engines can quote a single item without surrounding context.
export const contextFileFaqItems: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "What is a personal context file?",
    answer:
      "A personal context file is one structured profile that describes who you are and how you want AI to work with you. Every AI tool you connect reads it before it answers, so your context stays consistent across tools and sessions instead of being re-explained each time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is a personal context file different from a chatbot's memory?",
    answer:
      "Chatbot memory lives inside one app and cannot move with you. A personal context file is one portable file you own. It works across every agent you connect, and you can read, edit, or export it as plain Markdown at any time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do agents keep a personal context file updated?",
    answer:
      "As an agent learns something durable about you, a sharper preference, a new routine, or a goal that shifted, it proposes a narrow update. You approve what stays, or let trusted agents edit directly. Session chatter and one-off details are left out by design.",
  },
  {
    question: "What goes in a personal context file?",
    answer:
      "Creed organizes it into ten sections: Identity, Goals, Work, Preferences, and Routines as the always-on core, plus optional Beliefs, Constraints, People, Health, and Context. Each section is short, specific, and written to change how AI responds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which tools does a personal context file work with?",
    answer:
      "Creed connects to agents like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and ChatGPT over MCP, and integrates with GitHub for version control. Support for Notion and Obsidian is on the way.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I own my personal context file?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Creed is plain Markdown that you control. You bring your own AI key, your tokens stay yours, and you can export your data at any time.",
  },
