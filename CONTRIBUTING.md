# Contributing to Creed

Thanks for the interest. A few principles up front, then the practical
bits.

## What Creed is, in one paragraph

Creed is one personal context file every AI you talk to reads before
answering. It's not a notes app, not a chat log, not a memory dump.
The whole product depends on the file staying small, current, specific,
and worth reading. If a change makes Creed feel more like a journal,
dashboard, or generic AI wrapper, it's probably the wrong change. Read
[`lucidity.md`](./lucidity.md) before proposing a change that would
alter that posture.

If you're an agent reading this, also read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)
before you make changes.

## Before you open a PR

1. **Open an issue first** if it's a non-trivial change. Half-finished
   PRs are friction for everyone. A two-line issue asking "I'm thinking about
   doing X. Does that fit?" avoids it.
2. **Run the project locally** (see `README.md`). If you can't reproduce
   the behaviour you're changing, you can't be sure your change works.
3. **Read the file you're touching, not just the function.** Most files
   in this repo are organised top-down: types, then helpers, then the
   exported component / function. Changing a helper without
   reading the consumer at the bottom usually breaks something subtle.
4. **Don't add dependencies casually.** If you're adding a new package,
   say why in the PR description. We'd rather write a small helper than
   pull in a 200KB transitive dependency tree.

## Pull requests and releases

PRs squash-merge onto `main`. Write a lowercase, imperative title for the
one change that should land. Write the description as plain prose: what
changed, and anything a reviewer cannot see from the title. Do not use
Summary or Test plan headings.

Version Open, Cloud, CLI, and Bench only for a deliberate product release.
Git tags are `open-vX.Y.Z`, `cloud-vX.Y.Z`, `cli-vX.Y.Z`, and `bench-vX.Y.Z`.
The status site, docs site, and marketing pages are not versioned products.
The CLI cannot be versioned until `packages/creed-cli` exists again.

## What to verify before sending the PR

```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint must be clean (or no worse than main)
npm run typecheck     # zero new type errors
npm test              # every workspace test suite
npm run build         # production build must succeed
```

If you touched a route under either app or an API composition package, exercise it locally with
`curl` or the app and confirm the audit log entry shows up
(`creed_audit_events` table) where appropriate.

If you touched a Supabase migration, run `supabase db reset` from
`apps/open/` against a local Supabase before pushing. Schema-only PRs that
haven't been applied will not be merged.

## Coding style

We follow the surrounding code rather than a strict written style guide,
but a few things are non-negotiable:

- **TypeScript everywhere.** No `.js` files. Avoid `any`; `unknown`
  with a narrowing check is almost always better.
- **Server vs client components**: default to server. Add `"use client"`
  only when a hook, browser API, or interactive event genuinely needs it.
- **No em dashes in product copy** unless they were already there.
  (Hyphens are fine. Em dashes in code comments are fine.)
- **No unnecessary all-caps in UI text.** `BUTTON LABEL` reads as
  shouting; `Button label` reads as a button label.
- **Tailwind classes**: prefer the project's CSS-variable tokens
  (`var(--creed-text-primary)`, `accentColorMap[...]`) over raw hex.
- **No console.log in committed code.** Use `lib/observability.ts`'s
  `log.info / warn / error` if you need server-side logging.
- **API routes use `requireApiAuth`** unless they're explicitly
  unauthenticated (and you've thought hard about why).

## Architecture cheatsheet

`apps/open/` and `apps/cloud/` are thin build targets. Shared source lives in
`packages/creed-app/`; edition-specific source lives in `packages/creed-open/`
and `packages/creed-cloud/`. The independent status application lives in
`apps/status/`.

- `packages/creed-app/app/(creed-app)/` - shared authenticated product routes (`/file`,
  `/connections`, `/settings`).
- `packages/creed-app/app/` - shared public marketing routes and APIs.
- `packages/creed-open/app/` and `packages/creed-cloud/app/` - edition-owned routes and route compositions.
- `packages/*/app/api/app/*` - owner or session-authenticated user APIs.
- `packages/creed-app/app/api/creed/*` and `packages/creed-app/app/mcp/route.ts` - token-authenticated agent
  APIs.
- `packages/creed-app/components/creed/*` - shared product UI.
- `packages/creed-app/components/marketing/*` - shared public-site UI.
- `packages/creed-ui/*` - reusable interface primitives.
- `packages/creed-core/creed-data.ts` - shared types and section constants.
- `packages/creed-app/lib/creed-backend.ts` - shared Supabase reads and writes.
- `apps/open/supabase/migrations/*` and `apps/cloud/supabase/migrations/*` - edition-owned schema changes.

For deeper notes, see the comment block at the top of each file or
`AGENTS.md`.

## Changelog

Only major user-facing ships get a public changelog entry. See
[`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md). Tiny polishes do not.

## Tests

The shared app uses Node's test runner under `packages/creed-app/tests/`, and the status app
uses `tsx --test` under `apps/status/tests/`. Add focused coverage beside the owning
workspace and keep `npm test` green from the repository root.

## Reporting a security issue

Don't open a public issue. See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## Conduct

Be kind, be specific, and assume good faith. We'll add a more formal
code of conduct if the project grows enough to need one.
